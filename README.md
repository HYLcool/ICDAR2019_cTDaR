# ICDAR2019_cTDaR
The ICDAR 2019 cTDaR is to evaluate the performance of methods for table detection (TRACK A) and table recognition (TRACK B). For the first track, document images containing one or several tables are provided. For TRACK B two subtracks exist: the first subtrack (B.1) provides the table region. Thus, only the table structure recognition must be performed. The second subtrack (B.2) provides no a-priori information. This means, the table region and table structure detection has to be done.
